<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
Hello, thanks for dropping by my website!
I received my Economics PhD from the University of California, Irvine in 2024, with concentrations in Political Economy, Experimental Economics, and Game Theory. 
Since graduating, I have been working as a methodologist for the US Government. 
My primary research interests are in cyber security, international trade, experimental design, and network analysis.
However, give me a new dataset with an interesting research question, and I'll be happy!
</p>

<p>
Growing up near Lake Tahoe and spending my undergraduate years in San Luis Obispo means that outside of work and research, 
you can find me cycling, running, or enjoying the great outdoors! 
</p>

<p>
Please reach out with any questions.
</p>

        <p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center; width:95%;">
            <i>I study a model of weakest-link network defense. In this model, the defender
            determines the internal accessibility of a valuable asset and allocates defensive resources
            prior to an attacker’s decision to attack. In equilibrium, one of two resource allocations can
            arise: (1) both the defender and attacker allocate a strictly positive level of resources, or
            (2) the defender allocates a sucient level of resources to deter attacks. As the defender’s
            cost-adjusted valuation of an asset increases relative to the attacker, the defender is more
            willing to increase the internal accessibility of the asset, irrespective of the marginal benefit
            from increased accessibility. This model provides theoretical foundations for data breach
            and other cybersecurity settings.</i>

        <p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;">M. McBride, C. Deurlington</p>
        <hr style="margin-left:12.5%; width:75%;">
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center; width:95%;">
            <i>We provide an experimental test of the Conjectural Equilibrium concept in a
            threshold public good game with limited feedback. Consistent with our predictions,
            strategy profiles that are Conjectural Equilibria but not Nash Equilibria are more
            likely as feedback decreases, and subjects are more likely to hold incorrect beliefs
            as feedback decreases. However, risk aversion interacts with the feedback treatment,
            belief convergence occurs at different rates across treatments, and subjects intentionally
            choose not to maximize payoffs, thus complicating the use of Conjectural Equilibrium
            as a predictive concept. Overall, our findings support a measured approach to using
            the Conjectural Equilibrium concept to obtain predictions in limited-feedback settings.</i>

        <p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;">C. Deurlington</p>
        <hr style="margin-left:12.5%; width:75%;">

        <p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center; width:95%;">
            <i>In this article, I empirically examine the relationship between organizations’ cybersecurity measures 
            and their experienced level of incident frequency. Cybersecurity is an increasingly relevant
            concern for governments, businesses, and individuals. However, despite both rising investment
            in cybersecurity and frequency of cyber incidents, little research has been done to assess this
            relationship. Using fixed-effects regressions over multiple thresholds of incident frequency,
            this paper identifies staff cybersecurity training, data storage rules, and restrictions on
            personal devices used for work as measures associated with reduced incident frequency.
            Furthermore, this paper provides a foundational assessment of how cybersecurity measures
            are associated differently with phishing versus non-phishing incidents, providing a first step
            in understanding the usefulness of measures in preventing incidents of different severities.</i>

<p>C. Deurlington, E. Fisher, “Dynamic Level-k Thinking in the El Farol Bar Problem”</p>
<p style="font-size:12px; margin-left:5%;"><i>The El Farol Bar problem is a classic N-person anti-coordination game. 
Patrons independently decide whether to attend a venue with limited capacity; if too many arrive, each would prefer to have stayed home. 
We study a dynamic model of level-k thinking in which agents may randomly become one level more sophisticated over time. 
Short-run behavior depends on the rate at which agents upgrade their reasoning. 
In the long run, attendance is characterized by a binomial distribution with mean N/2, independent of preference parameters. 
We extend the analysis to a model of cognitive hierarchy and show that convergence to the mixed-strategy equilibrium occurs 
only on a set of initial conditions of measure zero.</i></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Select Testimonials</h2>

<p style="font-size: 10px;"><i>"He made the lecture material in his discussion very easily understandable and
summarized. I think his powerpoints were very concise yet detailed to include
main points from each chapter, and his explanations and examples in class were
extremely helpful to understand in more simple terms. Colin was a great TA, very
approachable, and honestly made this class one of my favorites because I felt
confident in the course material after going to his weekly discussions. I also liked
how he made a separate Canvas space for his discussion sections to keep things
organized in one space from the main Canvas course space. Keep it up and thank
you so much Colin!"</i> <b>[Behavioral Economics]</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 10px;"><i>"Colin did a great job of going more in-depth to what the professor was teaching and
made sure to go over important topics again. He did an amazing job breaking down
concepts and his notes during the discussion were very easy to follow along with."</i> <b>[Applied Econometrics I]</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 10px;"><i>"One of the best TAs I've had. Even though the material covered was not new to me,
I appreciated Colin's ability to slow down and take an in-depth approach to each
chapter."</i> <b>[Global Economy]</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 10px;"><i>"The TA had strong methods of showcasing course material visually and preparing
concise notes that successfully contributed to the understanding of students. The
TA was well prepared for student questions and encouraged them especially before
an exam. The TA was very accessible throughout the course as they were able to
offer additional resources or office hours when needed."</i> <b>[Economics of Asymmetric Information]</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 10px;"><i>"I believe that Colin's strong points include bringing up topics in which students
have difficulty understanding in their homework and discussing it further in class.
His presentations are concise and straight to the point, summarizing the focus of
the lectures of our professor. He also outlines what is expected during the
discussion session, giving us the amount of time he will be discussing, the amount
of time for questions, and the amount of time for group collaboration."</i> <b>[Economics of Religion]</b></p>
